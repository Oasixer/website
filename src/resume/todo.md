# My questions
* The whole thing, when exported, is currently too long. Suggestions about decrease font VS decrease spacing VS decrease content?
    * Add fontsize and spacing stuff to the settings

    * I CAN JUST ELIMINATE THE IRRELEVANT ONES

    * Resolve duplicates between languages and other sections
    * Maybe show EITHER languages section OR seperate frontend/backend if its a webdev job
* MOVE JS DOWN AND THATS FINE
    * Bother putting OS?
    * Does it even make sense to categorize frontend webdev + user interface as one category?
* Decide whether to include tags below experience GOOD
